<h1>You clicked on about me, that means you are interested in knowing this loser!!!. here we go</h1>
<p>well, I am an passout and pissed engineer, who graduated in the year 2022. I had a offer letter of Wipro during the climax of Engineering but I don't know whether working in an IT company is my passion or not.</p>
<p>
	Even though it was not my passion, I didn't knew what my passion was. So I simply joined the wipro for safer side. and don't ask about the salary please. They mentioned 3.5lpa as CTC in the offer letter, but I didn't knew what this CTC thing is so I thought it would be around 29K a month but the reality was different, It was actually 22K per month. after joining IT I was actually happy because some of my friends has offer lettes of multiple companies but due to recession most of the MNCs halted the joining. So I thought I was lucky.

later on I wanted to enter into the field of VLSI as many of my lecturers used to say it had much money and after 2-3 years the life will be set. So we bestfriends of KLECET ECE branch thought of joining the training institute. Since I had access to wfh and we didn't have to do much as a fresher and the recession did hit us, I thougt it is okay to join the training in the mean time. After six months I got selected to the ARM. and due to notice period in Wipro I had to leave the offer of ARM.
